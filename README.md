# Memory Card App

This project was created as part of the Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card). The main goal of this project was to get comfortable with the use of hooks or lifecycle methods as well as a lot of state.

This game puts your memory to the test. You are presented with multiple images of anime characters. The images get shuffled every-time they are clicked. You CAN NOT click on any image more than once or else your score resets to zero. The main objective is to get the highest score possible.
